# efcore-in-netstandard-with-aspnetcore-full-net-app
this is just a shitty little test to see about combining a netstandard library with an aspnet core full net project. The goal was to be able to add-migration and update-database to prove to someone on twitter that the combo does work, in order to help him figure out what he was missing. I was able to do both successfully. 

aka: nothing to see here
